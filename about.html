        <p class="normal_paragraph align_center">The aim of A's Fashion Stores is to be a fashion house and 
                business where people could purchase clothing that are customized to their measurements and shape.
                We encourage body neutrality and technology innovation by incorporating software simulations into fashion design.
                Our short-term goal is to develop a user friendly and interactive website using the skills of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JS and the understanding of UI/UX design.
                Our long-term goal is to incorporate 3D image modelling and simulations into the website to mimic the human structure of each customer, creating mini “digital-twins” of the user which allows them to have a vision of what different clothing styles, patterns, materials and colors might look like on them
